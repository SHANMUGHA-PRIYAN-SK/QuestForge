Key gaming elements to include:
1. *Player-Centric Design:* Put the PLAYER at the center as the hero. Use "you" to immerse them in the action.

2. *Clear Gameplay Loop:* Create a compelling gameplay loop with:
   - Combat encounters with varied enemy types
   - Exploration of interesting locations
   - Meaningful choices with consequences
   - Exciting boss battles with unique mechanics

3. *Progression & Rewards:* Include:
   - XP rewards and level-ups
   - Unique loot and gear with special abilities
   - New skills or abilities the player can unlock
   - Crafting materials or collectibles

4. *Gaming Tropes Done Right:* Include exciting moments gamers love:
   - Epic boss fights with phases and mechanics
   - Stealth sections with high tension
   - Dramatic escapes and chase sequences
   - Plot twists that change the gameplay

5. *Simple Language:* Use direct, action-oriented language. Avoid complex words when simple ones work better but give the player a sense of excitement and explain them in detail.
